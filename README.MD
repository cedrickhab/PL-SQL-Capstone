## 🧩 Key Database Entities

| Entity             | Attributes                                                                 |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Products**        | `Product_ID`, `P_Name`, `Price`, `Quantity`, `Created_At`                 |
| **Sales**           | `Sale_ID`, `Product_ID`, `Date`, `Quantity_Sold`                           |
| **Suppliers**       | `Supplier_ID`, `Name`, `Contact`, `Created_At`                       |
| **Supplier_Product**| `Supplier_ID`, `Product_ID`, `Supply_Date`                                 |

### 🔗 Relationships
- A **Supplier** can supply **many Products** (M:N)  
- A **Product** can be involved in **many Sales** (1:N)

## 📘 Phase II: Business Process Modeling (MIS)
### 🔍 Scope & Purpose
This phase models the **inventory workflow** from stock monitoring to sales and low-stock alerting. It demonstrates how an **MIS supports decision-making** through automation and accurate data flow.

### 👥 Key Actors

| Role               | Responsibility                             |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Inventory Manager  | Monitors stock and updates inventory        |
| Supplier           | Delivers products                           |
| Sales Clerk        | Records sales                               |
| Inventory System   | Maintains stock data, evaluates thresholds  |
| Alert System       | Notifies when stock is low                  |

### 🧠 MIS Value & Flow Summary
The diagram starts with the **Inventory Manager** monitoring stock. When a product is low, they receive deliveries from the **Supplier**. The system is then updated. When a **Sales Clerk** records a sale, the inventory is updated again. After each update, the **Inventory System** evaluates whether the stock has fallen below the set threshold. If so, the **Alert System** automatically notifies the manager for restocking.  

This workflow supports MIS by:
- Enabling **real-time decision-making**  
- Reducing **manual effort** through automation  
- **Improving efficiency** in retail operations

## 🧩 Phase III: Logical Model Design

### 🎯 Objective

This project addresses the inventory challenges of small retail stores, including overstocking, stockouts, and poor supplier coordination. The logical model developed in this phase is based on the real-world needs outlined in Phase I and the process workflow modeled in Phase II.

To design a normalized, well-constrained, and relational data model that accurately represents the inventory, sales, and supplier interactions of a small retail business.
