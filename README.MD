## 📘 Phase II: Business Process Modeling (MIS)
### 🔍 Scope & Purpose
This phase models the **inventory workflow** from stock monitoring to sales and low-stock alerting. It demonstrates how an **MIS supports decision-making** through automation and accurate data flow.

### 👥 Key Actors

| Role               | Responsibility                             |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Inventory Manager  | Monitors stock and updates inventory        |
| Supplier           | Delivers products                           |
| Sales Clerk        | Records sales                               |
| Inventory System   | Maintains stock data, evaluates thresholds  |
| Alert System       | Notifies when stock is low                  |

---

### 🧠 MIS Value & Flow Summary
The diagram starts with the **Inventory Manager** monitoring stock. When a product is low, they receive deliveries from the **Supplier**. The system is then updated. When a **Sales Clerk** records a sale, the inventory is updated again. After each update, the **Inventory System** evaluates whether the stock has fallen below the set threshold. If so, the **Alert System** automatically notifies the manager for restocking.  

This workflow supports MIS by:
- Enabling **real-time decision-making**  
- Reducing **manual effort** through automation  
- **Improving efficiency** in retail operations

## 💡 Simple Analytics Problem Statement

> “Analyze how many times each product has been sold to help determine restocking priorities.”

This was implemented using a **Window Function** on the `Sales` table to track total sales per product.

```sql
SELECT 
    p.Product_Name,
    s.Product_ID,
    SUM(s.Quantity_Sold) OVER (PARTITION BY s.Product_ID) AS Total_Sold
FROM Sales s
JOIN Products p ON s.Product_ID = p.Product_ID;
```
---
![Problem statement](./screenshots/Phase%20VI/problem%20statement.png)

---

## 🛠️ PL/SQL Components

### ✅ Procedure: `register_sale`

- Records a new sale
- Automatically decreases stock quantity
- Warns if stock is low
- Retrieved data using cursors


---
![Procedure](./screenshots/Phase%20VI/procedures.png)

---
#####  !!Cursors:
-data is now retrieved because of cursors

![cursors procedure](./screenshots/Phase%20VI/procedure%20completed%20by%20cursors.png)

---

## 🧠 Phase VII: Advanced Database Programming and Auditing

### 🎯 Objective

To secure the inventory system by implementing **trigger-based restrictions**, a **centralized audit system**, and **package-based logging** to ensure real-time monitoring, access control, and accountability for all table-level actions.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Small retail databases are vulnerable to unauthorized or unintended changes during business-critical times. This project implements advanced features like:

- ❌ Preventing table changes during weekdays and holidays
- 🕵️ Tracking who tried to change what and when
- 📦 Centralizing audit logic via PL/SQL packages

This adds a layer of **governance**, **traceability**, and **control**, critical for Management Information Systems.

---

## 📅 Holiday Restriction System

### ✅ `holiday_calendar` Table

Used to store blocked dates (holidays).

```sql
CREATE TABLE holiday_calendar (
    holiday_date DATE PRIMARY KEY,
    description  VARCHAR2(100)
);

-- Sample holiday entries
INSERT INTO holiday_calendar VALUES (TO_DATE('2025-06-01','YYYY-MM-DD'), 'National Day');
INSERT INTO holiday_calendar VALUES (TO_DATE('2025-06-15','YYYY-MM-DD'), 'Founders Day');
COMMIT;
```


![Holiday Table](./screenshots/Phase%20VII/holiday.png)

---

## 🧨 Trigger-Based Restriction Logic

### ✅ `trg_block_weekdays_holidays` on `Products`

Prevents DML on weekdays and public holidays.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trg_block_weekdays_holidays
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON Products
FOR EACH ROW
DECLARE
    v_today     VARCHAR2(10);
    v_is_holiday NUMBER;
BEGIN
    SELECT TO_CHAR(SYSDATE, 'DY') INTO v_today FROM dual;

    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO v_is_holiday
    FROM holiday_calendar
    WHERE holiday_date = TRUNC(SYSDATE);

    IF v_today IN ('MON', 'TUE', 'WED', 'THU', 'FRI') OR v_is_holiday > 0 THEN
        RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001, '🔒 DML blocked: Not allowed on weekdays or holidays.');
    END IF;
END;
```
---
![Trigger Created](./screenshots/Phase%20VII/restr%20trigger.png)

---
## 🕵️ Auditing System

### ✅ `audit_log` Table

Captures every insert/update/delete attempt with user ID, date, and status.

```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_log (
    audit_id     NUMBER GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id      VARCHAR2(30),
    action_date  DATE DEFAULT SYSDATE,
    table_name   VARCHAR2(50),
    operation    VARCHAR2(20),
    status       VARCHAR2(20),
    remarks      VARCHAR2(100)
);
```
---
![Audit Table](./screenshots/Phase%20VII/audit%20log%20created.png)

---
## 🔄 Trigger + Audit Combined

Trigger uses the package to log **ALLOWED or DENIED** attempts.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trg_audit_products
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON Products
FOR EACH ROW
DECLARE
    v_day        VARCHAR2(10);
    v_is_holiday NUMBER;
    v_status     VARCHAR2(20);
BEGIN
    SELECT TO_CHAR(SYSDATE, 'DY') INTO v_day FROM dual;
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO v_is_holiday
    FROM holiday_calendar
    WHERE holiday_date = TRUNC(SYSDATE);

    IF v_day IN ('MON','TUE','WED','THU','FRI') OR v_is_holiday > 0 THEN
        v_status := 'DENIED';
        audit_pkg.log_action('PRODUCTS', 'BLOCKED DML', v_status, 'Blocked by weekday/holiday trigger');
        RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20002, '🚫 Action denied by policy.');
    ELSE
        v_status := 'ALLOWED';
        audit_pkg.log_action('PRODUCTS', 'DML', v_status, 'Weekend or holiday not detected.');
    END IF;
END;
```
